    <p>I'm a business strategist with a passion for turning untapped engagement into tangible results, connecting technology companies to communities and stakeholders they otherwise wouldn't be able to reach. I identify and cultivate relationships, moving people from brand-aware to brand-advocate, while advising company executives on how to best leverage these community assets to drive growth and respond to feedback.</p>
    
    <p>I received a BA in Interdisciplinary Studies at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley</a>, culminating in a thesis with a focus on Sociology, Psychology, and Media Studies. I was a TA for the <a target="_blank"href="https://blockchain.berkeley.edu/courses/fall-2017-fundamentals-decal/">Blockchain Fundamentals Decal</a>, a leader at <a target="_blank" href="https://blockchain.berkeley.edu/">Blockchain at Berkeley</a>, and have been volunteering as the head of logistics for <a target="_blank" href="https://she256.org/">she256</a> since its inception. I have experience building organizations, conferences, and teams from the ground up and love working cross-functionally with diverse groups and individuals.</p>
    
    <p>My passions lie in areas of social good, diversity, equity, and inclusion for I believe that it is only through the uplifting of all that we achieve a better society. I spend a lot of my free time thinking about ethical applications of technology and thinking of solutions for the many inequities present in our society. Innovation is a process, so is the pursuit of justice. Constant proactive improvement is the only path forward.</p>

        <p align="justify"> <i id="introdoudna">The development of CRISPR-Cas9 technology has been a topic of hot debate in recent years. Like any new technology or discovery, it brings with it the promise of a better society but also warns of complete destruction at the other extreme. Those fearful of CRISPR cite concerns regarding its ability to edit the human germ-line and the ramifications of such tinkering. Jennifer Doudna and Hank Greely both acknowledge these concerns, while also dismissing them in favor of other more pressing concerns. In order for society to set priorities for the development of CRISPR-Cas9 technology, we must first address the various inequalities, incongruencies, and problems that exist today in order to create a future where technologies like CRISPR can be utilized for the greatest collective good.</i></p>

        <p align="justify"> <i id="introruss">In his text Human Compatible, Prof. Stuart Russell outlines his viewpoints on the future of artificial intelligence. Drawing on his years of work and research in the field of AI, Russell delineates the line between apocalyptic fact and fiction as he outlines what he believes is the fundamental flaw in AI so far. Focusing on the standard model of intelligence, Russell outlines the concept of provably beneficial AI as a revision of what he believes to be the fundamental flaw of AI design. Although Russell’s goal of provably beneficial AI is realizable and fixes a fundamental flaw in the prior base assumptions, I believe that the core barrier to achieving provably beneficial AI is the same problem that plagues most other systems in our society. By drawing parallels to capitalism, corporations, and government, I hope to show that Russell’s suggestions regarding the standard model need to be applied to all systems in order to secure a future for ourselves. Russell’s provably beneficial AI solves the greatest dangers inherent in the standard model of intelligence but also reveals the path to achieving a provably beneficial society.</i></p>

        <p align="justify"> <i id="thesis_abs">Particularly in the United States, partisan media bias (PMB) is more prevalent than ever before. In this study, I build upon previous frameworks describing partisan media bias to illustrate the severity of the partisan news media environment in the United States. I conducted my study using Media Cloud, an open-source platform for studying media ecosystems, to study the coverage of the Portland Protests following the murder of George Floyd. I found that reporting was significantly slanted to match outlet ideology when covering the Portland Protests. Analysis of top words also revealed significant differences in framing that also matched outlet ideology. I conclude my paper with implications for future research on partisan media bias and discuss other partisan divisions besides protest coverage.</i></p>

The club has 100 active members, according to its head of marketing, Cliff Ahn, a UC Berkeley senior; its public-facing Slack channel, a cloud-based messaging platform, includes 2,000 people. “This technology isn’t just about being able to buy bitcoin and invest in ether,” said Ahn. “It’s all the implications of the technology and what it can do to democratize money, politics, power, trust. All these problems that plague our society — a lot of them can be fixed with this technology. It’s just a matter of getting people to understand that.”</i></p>
